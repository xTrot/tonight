# Project Development Plan for Sprint #2

For Sprint #2 we are going to begin working with the front-end of our application with matching requirements and task descriptions utilizing code. All the views will be developed using an MVC approach utilizing dummy data that will be kept in a JSON file on the client side. To achieve this, we will begin working on the client side of the application and the views for each of our seperate functions. We also intend to begin working on the server for requests and database requests after we have finished with the client side. Once we have both sides running at prototype level, we will begin developing the communication between the client side and server side to get a general grasp of what we want our application to do. Once we feel like what we made is where we wanted to be, we will begin testing our application placing into priority our focus on the client side usability. We will end Sprint #2 by updating our Gantt with the progress we have achieved so far and create another development plan for Sprint #3 where our main focus will be to improve the functionality of our application.
