# Sprint Analysis #1:

1. What worked well? 

- For this sprint we had the task of mapping the ER diagram to a schema instance with all the logical restrictions and dependencies between the entities and their relationships, the mock ups of the app wireframes, and to update the plan for the next sprints. Our biggest success was mapping the ER diagram to a schema instance because everything seemed to fit into place with little to no trouble. For the second task, the part that worked best was the actual search for examples of simple mock ups to use as an idea for our design. This helped to ease this task by displaying the small snippets in word. Updating the future plans worked very well at the end of all the tasks because we had a clear vision of what we still needed to do for future sprints. 

2. What didn't worked well? 

- Only one of the three main tasks gave us a little problem since the entirety of the ER diagram mapping proved to be a simple task without too many problems and the future plans were clear at the end of our work. The mock ups became a little difficult because we had too much info on the screen and had to use very long sentences to reach our purpose. There was also the issue of using non-generic words in our dynamic content which was something we want to avoid, but became difficult finding the means to do so.

3. What we learned? 

- The ER mapping helped us learn how to represent the diagram in terms of tables in the database.  For this to be achieved we had to learn the finer details of how to achieve the larger task. We had to familiarize ourselves with the PostgreSQL language so as to work well with the database. This familiarization helped us in learning how to represent relationships in the database according to their cardinality, create dependencies between tables, and  represent multivalued, derived, and composite attributes. The mock ups helped us learn more about how to display data in an app and how more is less when planning the design. Using too much information in only one screen causes cluttering of all the information and makes it difficult for the users to see what they want. Realizing this, the lesson best learned was that not keeping things simple will cause us to lose focus of what we are trying to do and will eventually complicate our work in the long run. Updating the future plans taught us that we need to have clear focus of what we want to do and how we need to distribute the entire project into smaller tasks with a better time management sense. Planning ahead and having a clear idea of what to do next is just as important as working on the task at hand since it gives us a clear way to finish the project with lower risk of encountering a problem later on in the final stages. 

### What to do next 

- For Sprint #2 we will be working on the creation of the actual structure of the front end of the application using a JSON file. We will place our efforts in the development of the client pages, server requests, server database requests, and client/server communication. Once the development of these tasks are done, we will move on to their testing and finalize them when they pass all tests. We will also be drafting a new detailed project  development plan for Sprint #3.
