# Sprint Analysis #1:

1. What worked well? 

- For this sprint we had the task of mapping the ER diagram to a schema instance with all the logical restrictions and dependencies between the entities and their relationships, the mock ups of the app wireframes, and to update the plan for the next sprints. Our biggest success was mapping the ER diagram to a schema instance because everything seemed to fit into place with little to no trouble. For the second task, the part that worked best was the actual search for examples of simple mock ups to use as an idea for our design. This helped to ease this task by displaying the small snippets in word. Updating the future plans worked very well at the end of all the tasks because we had a clear vision of what we still needed to do for future sprints. 

2. What didn't worked well? 

- Only one of the three main tasks gave us a little problem since the entirety of the ER diagram mapping proved to be a simple task without too many problems and the future plans were clear at the end of our work. The mock ups became a little difficult because we had too much info on the screen and had to use very long sentences to reach our purpose. There was also the issue of using non-generic words in our dynamic content which was something we want to avoid, but became difficult finding the means to do so.

3. What we learned? 

- The ER mapping helped us learn how to represent the diagram in terms of tables in the database.  For this to be achieved we had to learn the finer details of how to achieve the larger task. We had to familiarize ourselves with the PostgreSQL language so as to work well with the database. This familiarization helped us in learning how to represent relationships in the database according to their cardinality, create dependencies between tables, and  represent multivalued, derived, and composite attributes. The mock ups helped us learn more about how to display data in an app and how more is less when planning the design. Using too much information in only one screen causes cluttering of all the information and makes it difficult for the users to see what they want. Realizing this, the lesson best learned was that not keeping things simple will cause us to lose focus of what we are trying to do and will eventually complicate our work in the long run. Updating the future plans taught us that we need to have clear focus of what we want to do and how we need to distribute the entire project into smaller tasks with a better time management sense. Planning ahead and having a clear idea of what to do next is just as important as working on the task at hand since it gives us a clear way to finish the project with lower risk of encountering a problem later on in the final stages. 

### What to do next 

- For Sprint #2 we will be working on the creation of the actual structure of the front end of the application using a JSON file. We will place our efforts in the development of the client pages, server requests, server database requests, and client/server communication. Once the development of these tasks are done, we will move on to their testing and finalize them when they pass all tests. We will also be drafting a new detailed project  development plan for Sprint #3.

# Sprint Analysis #2:

1. What worked well? 

- For this sprint, the overall task of defining and understanding what was asked of us was the thing that worked the best for us. We were able to organize ourselves accorindgly and begin with outlining the important views of our project. We also had an easy time understanding the use of bootstrap in creating the views and feel like our code is quite well made in this aspect. Storing the dummy data in JSON files is also another aspect that worked well for us along with updating our progress through the use of the Gantt chart and master development plan. 

2. What didn't worked well? 

- The actual process of creating the views we needed for this sprint is the main task that did not work well for us. Although we understood bootstrap well enough to create some views, other views that needed our code to use angular.js and css became difficult to make and use all together. It became more apparent that we needed to understand how different formats of code come together in different files to create the same page to represent out views. Unfortunately, we were not able to meet the goal we had planned for this sprint, but we understand that we have completed the goal stipulated in this sprint's guidelines through our interpretation. 

3. What we learned? 

- What we learned was the need to have risk management implemented in our bi-weekly processes of finishing each sprint. The things that did not work well in this project slowed down our process and in some occasion brought it to a stop while we tried to figure a solution for it. This made it very difficult to achieve what we had set out to do from the beginning for this sprint and we noticed that it was majorly due to the fact that we didn't know how to proceed rationally when we came upon this sudden problem. We understand now that having a plan of how to proceed throughout each sprint is important, but it is more important to make each plan flexible enough that it can encounter serious issues, resolve them, and still go on track to be able to finish all of our tasks on time. We believe this is the most important thing that we learned from this sprint. We also learned a lot more about creating jade code using bootstrap to make our views. Although it became very difficult to implement both angular.js and css for some of the views that we were able to finish, we realized that our overall understanding of boostrap coding had become much better and our code had become much cleaner than what we had done in practices. We also came to understand that it is very difficult to verify css and angular.js code applied to our bootstrap code only using the browser and app itself. We need to find another way to possibly make it better and more efficient.

### What to do next

- For Sprint #3 we plan to further our understanding of the coding needed to finish the views and give our application a more unique style. For this we will need to understand the implementation of css, angular.js, bootstrap, and jade coding better so that will be our first goal. We also plan to add to the tasks we weren't able to finish for this sprint along to the ones we have designated for Sprint #3 to help ourselves feel more confident about the other sprints in the future and show that we are indeed progressing in the understanding of this project.
